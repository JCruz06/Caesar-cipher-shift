# Caesar Cipher

## Overview

This project is a simple implementation of the Caesar Cipher in Python. The Caesar Cipher is one of the earliest and simplest methods of encryption, where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a fixed number of places down the alphabet.

## Features

- Encrypts plaintext using a specified shift value.
- Decrypts ciphertext using a specified shift value.
- Handles both uppercase and lowercase letters.
- Ignores non-alphabetic characters during encryption and decryption.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
